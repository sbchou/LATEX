In this chapter, we test for correlations between the metrics defined in Chapter 8 and popularity of a story on Twitter.

\section{Hypotheses}
Re-iterating from Chapter 7, the focus of Part II of this thesis is to examine how emotionally evocative text in an article relates to the way it is shared on Twitter. In addition, we look at the effects of story length on its popularity as a baseline to confirm theories of attention on the Internet.

For each of these three independent variables (story length, emotionality, positivity) we repeat analyses across three views of the data: first, the entire dataset; then, by political candidate followed amongst users who follow only one candidate; and finally, by the number of political candidates followed (degree of political engagement).

We hypothesize the following:

 FILL IT IN!!!!!! OR DO PER SECTION


\section{All Data}
\subsection{Hypotheses}
We hypothesize the following behavior in our dataset of stories and tweets:

\begin{itemize} 
    \item \textbf{H1:} Story length has a \emph{negative} correlation with Twitter shares, due to the effects of the Internet attention economy and overexposure to political media \cite{goldhaber1997attention}.
    \item \textbf{H2:} Emotionality has a \emph{positive} correlation with Twitter shares, consistent for viral content in general \cite{berger2012makes}.
    \item \textbf{H3:} Positivity has a \emph{negative} correlation with Twitter shares, due to the nature of political news and contrary to generalized findings \cite{berger2012makes}.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Methodology}

Since our dependent variable, tweet volume, is a set of discrete counts that are positively truncated, we use negative binomial regression models for our analysis \cite{scott1997regression}. The distribution of tweet volume is not a normal distribution, and it is not recommended to perform a log transformation on count data to fit it to an OLS regression unless there is little dispersion in the data \cite{o2010not}. Poisson models are a subset of negative binomial models without the dispersion parameter. Below, we see that the negative binomial model provides the best fit and that our data is overdispersed, as the dispersion parameter $\theta$ is greater than 1.   

In each case, we compare our findings to those using plain linear and Poisson regression models and are able to achieve the same significant results.
