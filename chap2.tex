\chapter{In Media We ... Trust?}

Despite the news media ecosystem's rapid evolution in the past decade, the question of fairness in reporting remains a valued one. Although counterarguments for subjective reporting exist (Glenn Greenwald, most famous for his coverage of whistleblower Edward Snowden's leaks, said that ``All journalism is a form of activism. Every journalistic choice necessarily embraces highly subjective assumptions--cultural, political or nationalistic--and serves the interests of one faction or another''), fair treatment of subjects and sources remain a central tenant to most publications \cite{Greenwald}. 
  
But an attempt at fairness on the side the reporter is not always perceived in equal effect under the eyes of the reader. Presenting contradictory facts to a reader's beliefs can even sometimes \emph{strengthen} their oppositions to it, a concept known as ``motivated skepticism'' \cite{taber2006motivated}.

In this section, we examine the impact of distrust in media, and explore the theories behind three main potential sources of media distrust: the characteristics of the reader, the source of the story and its use of language.

\section{Why Does Media Trust Matter?} 
 
 The idea that mass media has a large influence on the ramifications of democracy is nothing new. In 1922, political commentator, reporter, and writer Walter Lippman wrote about its central role in shaping public opinion:

     \begin{quote}Each of us lives and works on a small part of the earth's surface, moves in a small circle, and of these acquaintances knows only a few intimately. Of any public event that has wide effects we see at best only a phase and an aspect. This is as true of the eminent insiders who draft treaties, make laws, and issue orders, as it is of those who have treaties framed for them, laws promulgated to them, orders given at them. Inevitably our opinions cover a bigger space, a longer reach of time, a greater number of things, than we can directly observe. They have, therefore, to be pieced together out of what others have reported and what we can imagine.
    Yet even the eyewitness does not bring back a naive picture of the scene. 
    \cite{lippman1922public} 
    \end{quote} 

Many of the worries that Lippman had about the effects of poorly disseminated truth have been later confirmed in experimental studies. In short, when faced with a large and mistrusted news environment, we tend to rely on \emph{confirmation bias} when searching for information. This term, first coined in 1988, describes the psychological phenomeon of seeking or analyzing new information in ways that align with one's existing beliefs, expectations or prior hypotheses \cite{nickerson1998confirmation}.

Using a Bayesian voting model, a study from Georgetown University in 2005 was able to show that voters with low trust and a high dislike for the news media are significantly more influenced by their existing party identifications in casting ballots than current economic factors \cite{ladd2005attitudes}. The study attributes increasing polarization in the American political sphere with increasing lack of trust in the news, a serious implication for the highly polarized 2016 presidential elections. Moreover, distrust of media implies a large information loss in the public, whose avoidance of diverse ideas means a narrowing of information flow \cite{ladd2011americans}.

It comes as no surprise that our own political stances have a significant effect in our perceptions of bias in the media. 



%In even seemingly neutral stories, partisans tend to view reporting as biased against their own views. This phenomenon---deemed the ``hostile media effect''---was first studied at Stanford University by Robert P. Vallone, Lee Ross, and Mark R. Lepper in 1985 \cite{vallone1985hostile}. Although ``true'' neutrality of a story is nearly impossible to quantify due to the subjective nature of the concept, Vallone et. al were able to successfully demonstrate that partisans of \emph{both} sides (pro-Israeli and pro-Arab) viewed the same news segments as hostile towards their beliefs and favorable to the other side.

\subsection{The Role of Media Brands}




%The media, of course, is not just one unified mass, and in an increasingly fragmented ecosystem, the role of media brands is a crucial factor in the perception of bias. Although most research

%For instance, most research on the hostile media phenomenon conceptualizes the news media as an undifferentiated mass of information sources that individuals can (and do) reasonably characterize as having a uniform political orientation (Giner-Sorolla and Chaiken 1994, Peffley et al. 2001, Eveland and Shah 2003). Yet, the past two decades have seen a dramatic increase in the number and variety of news sources. One consequence is that Democrats and Republicans are increasingly likely to differ systematically in their assessments of specific media outlets.






%With the decline of print newspapers, a diverse number of new platforms and web-centric publications have risen.
