 \chapter{Metrics for Political and Emotional Engagement}

 In the following sections, we discuss the tools and methods that we use to analyze our independent variables.
 
\section{Emotional Coding}
For the emotional coding of news articles, we use dictionaries from the Harvard General Inquirer, a lexicon that is popular for computerized content analysis \cite{stone1963computer}. The Inquirer is a public-use alternative to the LIWC system, which in Berger and Milkman’s study of online virality showed results that were significantly positively correlated with the output of manual coding \cite{berger2012makes}. In particular, we use the \emph{Positiv} and \emph{Negativ} collections, a set of 1,915 well-established words signifying positive outlook (not including words for \emph{yes}) and 2,291 words signifying negative outlook (not including words for \emph{no}), respectively. Repeating the same metrics from \emph{What Makes Online Content Viral?}, we quantify for each document:

$$ emotionality = \frac{count(positiv \mid negativ)}{count(words)}$$
$$ positivity = \frac{count(positiv)}{count(words)} - \frac{count(negativ)}{count(words)}$$

as independent variables in our analysis.

 \section{Followership as a Proxy for Political Engagement}

In the following sections, we use Twitter followership as a proxy for measuring degrees of political engagement. 

Previous research in network analysis and attempts to predict latent political affiliations of users in the social network has shown that users on Twitter tend to show network homophily within political groups, and that ``like follows like'' \cite{colleoni2014echo}. In addition, followership of only Democratic or only Republican official accounts can be used as a reasonable estimator of party loyalty. Those accounts that follow only the officials of one party tend to demonstrate more closeness with other users in their political party than those who do not.
            
Due to the highly individual nature of this election, where candidate loyalty does not necessarily imply goodwill towards the party, we look specifically at what candidates users follow instead of party loyalty at large. 

For general \emph{levels} of political engagement, we look at the number of political candidates a Twitter user follows as a proxy for how likely they are to share political news. 

In addition, for single-candidate Tweeters, we divide users by the candidate they follow. At the time of data collection completion (May 1, 2016), the top two candidates by delegate count in each party were Hillary Clinton (D), Bernie Sanders (D) and Donald Trump (R) and Ted Cruz (R), so we split users into these four groups. 

%We call each group \emph{X}-followers where \emph{X} is the candidate name, although these do not include every person on Twitter who follows \emph{X}.  

\subsection{A Look at Candidate Followership}

Our dataset contains 6,406 unique single-candidate Twitter users. Trump-only followers lead with about 31\%, followed closely by Clinton-only (29\%), then Sanders (25\%) and Cruz (14\%).

  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{users-by-candid}  
  \caption{Number of Tweets by Each Segment
    \label{fig:users-by-candid}}
\end{figure} 

 

Trump's free media advantage becomes clear when looking at the \emph{volume} of tweets each group of users tweet: 37\% of tweets sharing articles come from Trump-only followers versus 27\% for Clinton-only, 20\% for Sanders-only, and 14.6\% for Cruz.

  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{tweets-by-candid}  
  \caption{Most frequently mentioned candidate in stories
    \label{fig:tweets-by-candid}}
\end{figure} 

 


Although candidate-followership is only a proxy for the latent variable of candidate loyalty, we are observe the nature of the content being shared by each group. Again, across all four segments, Republican candidate Trump leads the top number of mentions in stories shared.

  \caption{Number of candidates followed
    \label{fig:candid-ct}}
\end{figure}

36\% of Twitter users in our dataset follow none of the four political candidates, followed by 31\% who follow one candidate, 20\% who follow two, and 13\% who follow three or more candidates. 


\begin{figure}[H]  
\centering 
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{tweets-by-candid-ct}  
  \caption{Ratio of Tweets to political candidates followed
    \label{fig:candid-ct}}
\end{figure}

We see a U-shaped curve between the number of candidates followed (level of observed political engagement) and the ratio of political news tweets per user.


In the following analyses, we segment levels of political engagement into three groups for the sake of comparison:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{the unaffiliated} (those who follow no presidential candidates, but do tweet about political news)
  \item \emph{single-candidate} Tweeters (those who follow one and only one presidential candidate, and tweet about political news)
  \item \emph{political aficionados} (those who follow all 4 (or more) candidates, and tweet about political news)
\end{itemize}.

% \subsection{Who Are Single-Candidate Tweeters?}
% A qualitative peek into the characteristics of single-candidate tweeters shows a reasonable proxy for candidate loyalty. Examining the top 10 followers for each candidate by volume of tweets shared by each in our dataset, we see a mix of personal, organizational, and other accounts.

% Below is a random sample of the profile descriptions of 10 single-candidate tweeters (usernames excluded for the sake of privacy):
 
% \begin{itemize}  

% \item\emph{Clinton follower}: I write about climate change, Nikola Tesla, and Abraham Lincoln. Oh, and I'm an aquarium nut. Go figure.

% \item\emph{Trump follower}: Trump supporter, free-lance writer, loves life, liberty \& the pursuit of happiness

% \item \emph{Sanders follower}: I am an Android. MUST NOT SLEEP; MUST WARN OTHERS
