\section{Reader Demographics}

\section{Media Favorability of Candidates}
Each reader was asked to score the five stories according to how favorable each one was to the featured candidate (by headline).

\end{figure}
 
Scores were collected on a three-point scale, Favorable (1), Unfavorable (-1), or Neutral (0).

Overall, media coverage of Trump was viewed as most negatively biased, with over half of stories (51.1\%) viewed as unfavorable towards the candidate.

Of the stories shown, both Sanders and Clinton were viewed as having more positive than negative coverage, at 38.9\% of the 180 annotations being positive. Sanders also had the least negative coverage, with only 18.3\% stories shown being viewed as negatively biased against the candidate. Republican candidate Cruz was also seen to have more negative (33.3\%) than positive (28.9\%) stories about him, although the majority were seen as neutral (37.8\%).
